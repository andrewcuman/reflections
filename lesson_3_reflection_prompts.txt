When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For instance, if you work on another device, you could connect to your GitHub account and edit the repository from there
without having to wait for your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You have the opportunity to decide if the modifications you did are an incremental logic unit.
