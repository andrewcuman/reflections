When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For instance, if you work on another device, you could connect to your GitHub account and edit the repository from there
without having to wait for your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You have the opportunity to decide if the modifications you did are an incremental logic unit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks works only on GitHub website, whereas clone works on local machine to clone a local repository.
You can also use clone to copy a remote repository, in this case an automatic origin remote is added for you.
Branches are only use in local environment.
